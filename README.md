# PMO Mini Games

Migrated from Heroku, all PMO mini games that were coded shall now be based in GitHub.

Below are the games:
* Potion Mix (used in RFF, PMO TAR and Survivor games)
* Slide Puzzle (used in PMO TAR Hazard Zone)
* Sokoban / Barrel Puzzle (used in PMO Pa-TARs Day and PSL Aklan)
* and others (which I'm too lazy to list)

In the future, new games shall still be maintained under the same repository to reduce the number of repos.
